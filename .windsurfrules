# Package Management and Dependencies

1. Core Dependencies:
   - React: v19.0.0
   - Next.js: v15.1.4
   - UI Components: Schadcn
   - Styling: Tailwind CSS with class-variance-authority

# File Extensions

1. Client-side files:

   - Use .tsx for React components

# Performance Guidelines

1. Use Next.js features:

   - App Router for routing
   - Server Components where possible
   - Image optimization with next/image
   - Font optimization with next/font

2. Optimization:
   - Use proper chunking and code splitting
   - Implement proper lazy loading
